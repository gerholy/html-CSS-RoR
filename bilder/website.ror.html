<h1>Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning (WAR) is a fantasy MMORPG from BioWare Mythic and Electronic Arts. Based on the popular Warhammer Fantasy setting developed by Games Workshop, the game has a strong Realm vs. Realm (RvR) focus, pitting the sides of Order and Destruction against each other in PvP warfare. 
  WAR also introduces Public Quests that take place in the game's open world and require player cooperation, and features a massive Tome of Knowledge 
  that keeps track of your actions in-game and provides information about Warhammer lore.


  FEATURES
  
 <h2>Seven Races | Play as the Armies of Order and choose between the Dwarfs, Empire, and High Elves, join the Armies of Destruction and pick between the Greenskins, Chaos, and Dark Elves, or play as the Skaven in high-level PvP.
  Realm vs. Realm | Engage in a variety of PvP modes, including random Skirmishes, objective-driven Battlefields, instanced Scenarios, and epic Campaigns.
  Public Quests | Participate in Public Quests to join other players in completing open-world, tiered objectives and earn special rewards.
  Tome of Knowledge | Keep track of your in-game activities with the Tome of Knowledge as you unlock information about the game's story and Warhammer lore.
