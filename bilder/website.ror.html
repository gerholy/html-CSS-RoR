<h1>Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning (WAR) is a fantasy MMORPG from BioWare Mythic and Electronic Arts. Based on the popular Warhammer Fantasy setting developed by Games Workshop, the game has a strong Realm vs. Realm (RvR) focus, pitting the sides of Order and Destruction against each other in PvP warfare. 
  WAR also introduces Public Quests that take place in the game's open world and require player cooperation, and features a massive Tome of Knowledge 
  that keeps track of your actions in-game and provides information about Warhammer lore.
